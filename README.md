##Synopsis

This project provides a graphical user interface for converting documents to PDF, and adding scripts to PDFs.

##Motivation

This project was created to substitute for Adobe Acrobat Professional, which was formerly required to batch process PDFs. It is expensive, and the cost did not justify the limited, specific use. 

##Building

To build, clone into Visual Studio (2015 recommended).
