<h1>Getting Started Guide</h1>

<p>This portion of the guide will walk you through how to operate the tool at a basic level. To begin, press <b>Select Files</b> in the top left corner. Select any Microsoft Office Excel, PowerPoint, or Word files, as well as any PDFs you would like to convert and/or time stamp. You may use the <b>Ctrl</b> key and click to select multiple files individually, or the <b>Shift</b> key and click to select a range of files. All files you select will not be modified during the process, and will remain in their original folders. Copies of each file will be made, and the copies will be manipulated.</p>

<p>Once you have selected your files, you may then use one of the available processing options. <b>Convert</b> will convert any non-PDFs to PDF, without applying and fields or scripts. <b>Convert & Time Stamp 24 Hours</b> will convert any non-PDFs to PDF, and then apply a time stamp on print script that will mark the documents for 24 hours from when they are printed. <b>Convert & Time Stamp 30 Days</b> will do the same, but marking the documents for 30 days after printing.</p>

<p>The results will be saved under <b>My Documents\PDF Conversion And Time Stamp Tool</b>. You may restart the process if you wish to convert or time stamp more files.</p>
